# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a game that challenges your logic and strategy skills. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where you and your opponent take turns placing Xs and Os. The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. 

## This Repository
This Tic Tac Toe repository is my execution of building a simple browser game written in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It uses a simple grid layout and event listeners to handle the user interactions. The game logic is implemented with a one-dimensional array and a function that checks for winning combinations based on a constant array of winning combos.
